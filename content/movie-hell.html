        <hr>
        <p class="body-text">For our mythological creature, we think it would be appropriate to have Chris Hemsworth play the role. Our mythological creature requires someone who had deceived people in their past. While this is a very broad criteria to have, when first starting out, Chris Hemsworth allegedly lied about his height in order to gain an acting role. The creature will be found in the ninth circle where sinners are forced to traverse a never-ending maze. The purpose of the creature is to pose as a guide and to deceive the sinners into believing that they are close to reaching the end of the maze, but unbenounced to the sinners, the maze has no end.</p>
